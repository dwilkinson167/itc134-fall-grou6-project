I woke up to the sounds of an alarm screeching in the town center. 
A weird pit fell into my stomach, as though someone had knocked the
wind out of me. I knew what today was, I wanted to think my mind was 
wandering in a dream land, a utopia, but I was wrong. This was reality.
I walked out of my room, and saw my mother cooking on the kitchen stove, 
the aroma of cinnamon, and apple filling up the room. She sobbed
silently to herself, as she too knew today was another day to protest on the street.
"Mom, thanks for being supportive and preparing gas masks and umbrellas for me and my friends." I said.
"Be safe! We're having chicken stew for dinner."
I knew that she was worried about my safety but she also understood that young people
need to stand up and fight for freedom and democracy. I put the masks and umbrellas and my will
in my backpack because we both knew that I might not be able to come home today.
